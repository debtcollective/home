            In a workplace, workers come together to defend and fight for their
            interests against greedy bosses and owners. Similarly, debtors are
            coming together to form a union to defend our interests. We use our
            collective power to fight for better conditions in our financial
            lives and a more equitable society: the cancellation and
            renegotiation of debts, access to publicly-funded goods (education,
            healthcare, housing, etc), anti-racist economic policies, and much
            more.
